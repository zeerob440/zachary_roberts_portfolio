<p>
    These are my very first javaScript programs. I developed my portfolio schema and realized I needed javaScript to make it
    a (virtual) reality. I knew what structures I needed for my portfolio from my experience with Python, but I had to learn
    javaScript syntax along the way. Needless to say it was alot of work, alot of looking up how to, but I learned alot.
    These programs represent the very bleeding-edge of my skills in frontend engineering; the moon shot of my current skills.<br>

    I learned how to declare variable, equality operator ("5" == 5, TRUE; "umm, what?") strict euality operators "5" === 5; FALSE; "That's more like it!"
    I also learned how to write a for loop and print directly to a webpage.

    <dd><p>hangman was an assignment in a software class, but as I worked on it I found my kids enjoyed playing it.
        To optimize it I added a game mode selector so two players can play it. One player can create the word
        another player guesses. I especially enjoyed programming the ASCII art. I believe thoughtfully designed UI leads
        to great UX. For instance this program does not have a guesses remaining counter becaues the ASCII art already 
        serves that purpose in a more immerssive manner.

    <dd></dd><p>scrabble_score_program is a simple score keeping program. I consider it a true program because it was developed to
        solve a real use case. My wife and I play scrabble, but often don't want to bother looking for a pen and paper. This 
        program though simple keeps score well, thereby providing me a tool to empiricaly measure how badly my wife beats me at 
        scrabble.
