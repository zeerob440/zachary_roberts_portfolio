    These are my very first javaScript programs. I developed my portfolio schema and realized I needed javaScript to make it
    a (virtual) reality. I knew what structures I needed for my portfolio from my experience with Python, but I had to learn 
    javaScript syntax along the way. Needless to say it was alot of work, alot of looking up how to, but I learned alot.
    These programs represent the very bleeding-edge of my skills in frontend engineering; the moon shot of my current skills.<br>

    I learned how to declare variable, equality operator ("5" == 5, TRUE; "umm, what?") strict euality operators "5" === 5; FALSE;
    "That's more like it!" I also learned how to write a for loop and print directly to a webpage with innerHTML. The most important
    concept I learned is how to save key value pairs to the browser as a global repository. I still have a long way to go in javaScript,
    but as a result of these three abitious programs, my understanding of javaScript is greater than it was before I started.

    <dd>
    <p>toggle.js is a program that determines which "skin" is active from the browser, listens for a click from class styleToggle button in root/index.html,
        it assigns "modern" if nothing is set in the browser. If the current value in "skin" is "retro" it assigns "modern" and redirects to the homepage.
        Otherwise, it applies "retro" and redirects the user to transition/index.html. This program was hard to write as I am just starting out in javaScript,
        but from Python I knew I required either a boolean condition test or an if else structure to make it function, the biggest thing I learned was how to store
        information to the browser and retrieve it.

    <p> Jurassic Park is my 2nd favorite book and movie of all time. I read it in second grade. I needed a dictionary and alot 
        of grit to finish it, but I understood a lot of it. It was a difficult task, but my reading comprehension was sling-shotted 
        far above my grade level as a result.<br>

        wht_rbt_obj.js is a for loop that prints directly to a webpage. Once it finishes it redirects to root/index.html with
        retro.ccs applied. This program taught me how to build a for loop in javaScript, and print it to a webpage. wht_rbt_obj.js
        outputs in transition/index.html. transition/index.html is styled by terminal.css, designed to look like a mid-1990s terminal. 
        It serves as a fun easter egg and a cinematic transition from modern.css and retro.css.

    <dd></dd><p>scrabble_score_program is a simple score keeping program. I consider it a true program because it was developed to
        solve a real use case. My wife and I play scrabble, but often don't want to bother looking for a pen and paper. This 
        program though simple keeps score well, thereby providing me a tool to empiricaly measure how badly my wife beats me at 
        scrabble.
