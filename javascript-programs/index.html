    These are my very first JavaScript programs. I developed my portfolio schema and realized I needed JavaScript to make it
    a (virtual) reality. I knew which structures I needed for my portfolio from my experience with Python, but I had to learn 
    JavaScript syntax along the way. Needless to say, it was a lot of work and research, but I learned a lot.
    These programs represent the very bleeding-edge of my skills in frontend engineering; the moonshot of my current skills.
</p>
<p>
    I learned how to declare variable, equality operator ("5" == 5, TRUE; "umm, what?") strict equality operators "5" === 5; FALSE;
    "That's more like it!" I also learned how to write a for loop and print directly to a webpage with innerHTML. The most important
    concept I learned was DOM manipulation, this concept will be integral for future website programs. I still have a long way to go
    in JavaScript, but as a result of these three ambitious programs, my understanding of JavaScript is greater than it was before I
    started.

    <p>toggle.js is a program that determines which "skin" is active from the browser, listens for a click from class styleToggle button in
        root/index.html,it assigns "modern" if nothing is set in the browser. If the current value in "skin" is "retro" it assigns "modern"
        and redirects to the homepage.Otherwise, it applies "retro" and redirects the user to transition/index.html. This program was hard
        to write as I am just starting out in JavaScript,but from Python I knew I required either a Boolean condition test or an if-else
        structure to make it function, the biggest thing I learned was how to store information to the browser and retrieve it.

        <p> Jurassic Park is my 2nd favorite book and movie of all time. I read it in second grade. I needed a dictionary and a lot 
            of grit to finish it, but I understood a lot of it. It was a difficult task, but my reading comprehension was sling-shotted 
            far above my grade level as a result.

        <p>
            wht_rbt_obj.js is a for loop that prints directly to a webpage. Once it finishes, it redirects to root/index.html with
            retro.ccs applied. This program taught me how to build a for loop in JavaScript, and print it to a webpage. wht_rbt_obj.js
            outputs in transition/index.html. transition/index.html is styled by terminal.css.

        <p>loader.js determines which CSS file the browser should load. It checks the saved
            "skin" value in localStorage (modern as default). Next, it determines the current file depth
            in the folder structure by splitting the file path into a list. It subtracts the first 
            and last elements of the list to calculate directory depth. A for loop then builds a prefix of 
            "../" repeated for each level. Finally, it concatenates the prefix with either "modern.ccs", or
            "retro.ccs" thereby allowing the correct stylesheet to load, despite which page calls loader.js.
            loader.js is distributed across all pages except transition/index.html, as it uses the static stylesheet
            terminal.css.
