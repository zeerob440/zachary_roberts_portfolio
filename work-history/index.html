        <dt>2003-2009</dt>
        <dd>United States Army, Fox Company 151st Infantry (INANG). I learned leadership, and critical thinking as an<br>
            E-4 infantryman.</dd>
        <dt>2009-2012</dt>
        <dd>St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, EKG Tech. I learned how to read EKG strips, I was able to understand how waves<br>
            represent different heart arrhythmias. It has helped me understand programming in a way.</dd>
        <dt>2013-2018</dt>
        <dd>Kindred Hospital Northern Indiana, Lead EKG Tech> EVS Manager > Safety Officer. I started as the Lead EKG Tech<br>
            where I was able to improve EKG tech accuracy by studying artifact in ekg leads, and switching to new leads.<br>
            I was promoted to EVS Manager to in-house cleaning services in the hospital. I implemented an Adenosine<br> 
            Triphosphate testing program, which drove down hospital acquired infections because cleaning became targeted based on<br>
            empirical data. I was promoted to Safety Officer soon after, Where I lead the physical environment management plans<br>
            Life Safety, Emergency Management, Utilities, and Medical Equipment Management. This is the role I learned to think<br>
            at a systems level, which has proven valuable to software engineering.</dd>
            <dt>2018-Present</dt>
            <dd>Beacon Health System, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. I facilitated a National Guard deployment to the hospital<br>
                I was assigned to, I was awarded the COVID Hero Award from Elkhart General Hospital in 2020 for leadership in crisis<br>
                In 2024 Everbridge was selected to be the new mass notification software for the health system. Implementing the<br>
                system was assigned to me. I automated department business rules into mass notification programs within the Everbridge<br>
                system, while no code was required to configure the system, sound software design was required to configure the system<br>
                such as selection structures, booleans, and conditions. In October 2025 I designed a messaging role in Everbridge<br>
                at the request of Information Systems, that replaced their legacy emergency messaging process department-wide.
