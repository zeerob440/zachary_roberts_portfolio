        <dd>Beacon Health System, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. I facilitated a National Guard deployment to my assigned hospital.
            I was awarded the COVID Hero Award from Elkhart General Hospital in 2020 for leadership in crisis.
            In 2024 Everbridge was selected to be the new mass notification software for the health system. Implementing the
            system was assigned to me. I automated department business rules into mass notification programs within the Everbridge
            system, while no code was required to configure the system, sound software design was required to configure the system
            including selection structures, booleans, and condition tests. In October 2025 I designed a messaging role in Everbridge
            at the request of Information Systems that replaced their legacy emergency messaging process department-wide.

        <dd>Kindred Hospital Northern Indiana, Lead EKG Tech> EVS Manager > Safety Officer. I started as the Lead EKG Tech
            where I was able to improve EKG tech accuracy by studying artifact in ekg leads, and switching to new leads.
            I was promoted to EVS Manager to in-house cleaning services in the hospital. I implemented an Adenosine
            Triphosphate testing program, which drove down hospital acquired infections because cleaning became targeted based on
            empirical data. I was promoted to Safety Officer soon after, Where I lead the physical environment management plans
            Life Safety, Emergency Management, Utilities, and Medical Equipment Management. This is the role I learned to think
            at a systems level, which has proven valuable to software engineering.</dd>

        <dd>St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, EKG Tech. I learned how to read EKG strips, I was able to understand how waves
            represent different heart arrhythmias. It has helped me understand programming in a way.</dd>

        <dt class ="fyre">2003-2009</dt>
        <dd>United States Army, Fox Company 151st Infantry (INANG). I learned leadership, and critical thinking as an
