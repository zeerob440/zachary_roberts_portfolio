<p>
    Python was the first programing language I learned. I've been programming in Python for about a year now. Since Python is my first language
    I tend to think in terms of Python when learning other languages.

    <dt class ="new">pythonCartographer.py</dt>
    <dd><p>I consider pythonCartographer to be my first real application because it was developed to
        provide a solution for an actual usecase. pythonCartographer is loaded as a file inside an IDE where another Python
        program is being developed, pythonCartographer is used as a reference guide to build the new program. When new 
        structures are discovered they are documented in pythonCartographer for future reference, hence the "cartographer" 
        part of the name. It draws a map into structure and syntax as I learn it.</p></dd>

    <dt class ="new">hangman.py</dt>
    <dd><p>hangman was an assignment in a software class, but as I worked on it I found my kids enjoyed playing it.
        To optimize it I added a game mode selector so two players can play it. One player can create the word
        another player guesses. I especially enjoyed programming the ASCII art. I believe thoughtfully designed UI leads
        to great UX. For instance this program does not have a guesses remaining counter becaues the ASCII art already 
        serves that purpose in a more immerssive manner.

    <dt class ="new">scrabble_score_program.py</dt>
    <dd></dd><p>scrabble_score_program is a simple score keeping program. I consider it a true program because it was developed to
        solve a real use case. My wife and I play scrabble, but often don't want to bother looking for a pen and paper. This 
        program though simple keeps score well, thereby providing me a tool to empiricaly measure how badly my wife beats me at 
        scrabble.
