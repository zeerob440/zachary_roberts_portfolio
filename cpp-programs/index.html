<h4 class="construction_cpp">Early Stages of Learning C++</h4>
<p>
   At this point in my engineering career, I need to learn a compiled language. That compiled language is C++. I strongly feel passion drives innovation.
   Since C++ is widely used in entertainment, I believe it will continue to outpace other compiled languages into the intermediate future in both entertainment and enterprise.
   I am also intrigued with it because it excels at both procedural and object-oriented programming. I understand learning it will be a challenge, but nothing worth
   doing is easy, and I will have a greater range as an engineer for it with C++.
