    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Zachary Roberts, and I am a curious systems-level thinker transitioning from Healthcare Emergency Management to Software Engineering. I discovered a passion for software
        development while assigned to the implementation phase of an emergency mass notification system at a regional healthcare system. I could always see an
        underlying order within the chaos of every emergency I managed; I would leverage that modicum of order and structure to stabilize the overall incident.
        Software engineering is an extension of that paradigm, creating a bridge of logic over a sea of chaos to improve the lives and realities of others. I
        designed software with the guiding principles of reliability, resiliency, and user experience. I feel that if the UX is engaging, perhaps even cinematic,
        the user will remember what is being communicated.
